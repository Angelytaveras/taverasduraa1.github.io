<td>Abstract</td>
<td>In this site, it is discussed how your results from treatment in physical therapy are not solely based on the sessions but on your daily lives. There are many new devices that can help everyone, not just physical therapy patients, improve their health. The examples used in this site are smart watches and fit bits. Smart watches are excellent for tracking heart rates and steps. Additionally, they aid people in staying consistent with their specific physical therapy goals. Similarly, fitbits are also great for tracking and storing data. This data can be very useful to therapists especially when creating custom treatment plans for each patient.</td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>In this site they discuss technological improvements in physical therapy as a whole. However, they go in-depth on several of the new devices that technology has provided us with. For example the skin sleeves and sensor technology. Both these devices are great for tracking patients while in sessions and outside in their daily lives. They are essential for collecting biometric data and for ensuring that patients are following treatment outside of the sessions. Sensor technology is so small they can be worn in many different ways making it more convenient for patients.</td>
