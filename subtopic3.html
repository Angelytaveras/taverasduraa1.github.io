<td>Abstract</td>
<td>In this site, rehabilitation robots are explained and their functions. Rehabilitation robots are devices that operate automatically and are meant to enhance mobility in patients that are impaired. They discuss the different types of robots and what they are used for. The types of robots discussed are assistive robots and  therapy robots. Assistive robots are used for patients that have lost limb movement. While therapy robots, often called rehabilitators are used for patients to practice different movements that they struggle with. It is discussed how rehabilitation robots also come with constraints, a major one being cost. Because of how high in cost these robots can be it is very limited to who gets access to them.</td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>In this site, they introduce robotic rehabilitation and what conditions it can treat. With robotic rehabilitation there are a variety of conditions that can benefit from it. Which allows for a great portion of people to gain from it rather than just certain people. Some of the conditions this site states that they can treat with robotic rehabilitation are strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries and Parkinson's disease. According to this site some of the results of robotic rehabilitation are greater and accurate range of motion, increased strength and enhanced capability of limbs with impairments.</td>
